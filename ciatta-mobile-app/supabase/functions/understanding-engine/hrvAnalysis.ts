/**
 * Pure HRV analysis: no Deno/Supabase imports, same testing approach as
 * every other module here. Structurally identical to stepsAnalysis.ts —
 * both feed the 'recovery' Understanding — but averages same-day readings
 * instead of summing them, since HRV is a physiological state, not a
 * cumulative quantity like steps. Uses a gentler low-day threshold (30%
 * below baseline vs steps' 50%) since HRV is typically less volatile
 * day-to-day than step count, so a smaller relative dip already means
 * something.
 *
 * HealthKit reports SDNN, Health Connect reports RMSSD — both real HRV
 * metrics, computed differently, currently read as one undifferentiated
 * 'hrv' signal (noted in the ingestion code, not silently pretended away).
