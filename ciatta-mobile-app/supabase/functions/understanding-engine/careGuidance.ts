// Guidance and Care Connection — an extension of the Understanding layer,
// not a parallel engine. This is the single place Guidance is derived
// anywhere in the system; every domain's upsertUnderstanding() call routes
// through it at the same point the Understanding itself is written, from
// the exact same `strength` that already gated whether the Understanding
// was actionable in the first place. There is deliberately no path that
// produces Guidance from raw Observations directly.
//
// Distinctions this file exists to keep straight (per the product's
// Guidance Safety rules):
//   Observation    — what was measured or reported (the observations table)
//   Pattern        — what changed or appears connected (the Relationship
//                    lookup below, when one already exists in the model)
//   Understanding  — the current narrative this module is handed, never
//                    generated here
//   Guidance       — what the user may reasonably consider (this module's
//                    one output)
//   Action         — what the user chooses to do (not this module's
//                    concern at all)
//
// Guidance never diagnoses, prescribes, or determines treatment — every
// sentence this module can produce is enumerated below; nothing is
// templated from free text, so there is no way for it to say more than
// this file says it can.
//
// The `guidance` string answers three distinct questions, in order, as
// three sentences — still one plain-text field, still the same column,
// still nothing outside this file's own enumerated maps:
//   1. WHY does this hold?             — evidenceSentence(), built only
//      from the Understanding's own already-persisted evidence metadata
//      (observations_count, learning_since/first_observed) — never from
//      external knowledge.
//   2. WHAT might the user consider?   — considerSentence(), a fixed,
//      closed-form action per domain (CONSIDER_ACTION below).
//   3. WHEN might a provider help?     — the original connected-domain-
//      aware care sentence, unchanged in content and behavior.
