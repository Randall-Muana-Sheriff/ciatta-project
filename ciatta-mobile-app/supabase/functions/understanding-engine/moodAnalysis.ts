/**
 * Pure mood analysis: no Deno/Supabase imports, same testing approach as
 * every other module here. Produces the last remaining standalone
 * Understanding — 'mood' has, until now, only ever been a Relationship
 * target (cycle -> mood, sleep -> mood, recovery -> mood), never described
 * on its own.
 *
 * Unlike sleep/steps/HRV, mood_rating is curiosity-sourced and gated by the
 * daily rotation (one of three domains asked per day), so it accumulates
 * far slower than device-synced data. Eligibility is sized by answer
 * count, not calendar days — there's no daily density to assume.
