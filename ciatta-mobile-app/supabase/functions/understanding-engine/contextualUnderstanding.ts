// Contextual Understanding — the initial, user-reported counterpart to the
// physiological Understandings the other four domain processors produce.
// Same table, same upsertUnderstanding() write path, same Guidance gate —
// this file only ever answers two questions: which domain does an
// onboarding concern belong under, and what does an honest Understanding
// built from nothing but that concern look like. It never touches
// Observations, Evidence, or the understandings table directly; index.ts's
// processContextualDomain() does that, the same way every other domain's
// process*Domain() does.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT do: paraphrase or summarize the user's
// free-text elaboration into a diagnosis-shaped claim ("you have chronic
// fatigue"). Free-text summarization is exactly the kind of inference this
// system has no reliable way to make (there is no NLP/LLM layer anywhere
// in this codebase) — inventing one here to sound more specific would be
// the fabrication the product spec explicitly rules out. The narrative
// below is built entirely from structured signals the user actually chose
// (the concern chip or its literal text, the recency chip, which of the
// existing five domains their words matched) plus, verbatim, their own
// elaboration — never a rewritten version of it.
